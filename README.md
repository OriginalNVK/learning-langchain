# LangChain Course

Welcome to the LangChain Course repository! This repo contains all the code examples you'll need to follow along with the LangChain Master Class for Beginners. By the end of this course, you'll know how to use LangChain to create your own AI agents, build RAG chatbots, and automate tasks with AI.

## Course Outline

1. **Setup Environment**
2. **Chat Models**
3. **Prompt Templates**
4. **Chains**
5. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
6. **Agents & Tools**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or 3.11
- Poetry (Follow this [Poetry installation tutorial](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install Poetry on your system)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   <!-- TODO: UPDATE TO MY  -->
   git clone https://github.com/OriginalNVK/learning-langchain
   cd learning-langchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install --no-root
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:

   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the variables inside with your own values. Example:

   ```bash
   mv .env.example .env
   ```

4. Activate the Poetry shell to run the examples:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

5. Run the code examples:

   ```bash
    python chat_models/basic.py
   ```
